# AeroGear-OTP-iOS - Objective-C One Time Password API

A iOS library for generating one time passwords according to [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

## Getting started

The project requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

_BEFORE_ you can run the tests, you need to run the following command:

    pod install

Now you are almost done! You just need to open the ```aerogear-otp.ios.xcworkspace``` in order to run the TODO app!

Enjoy!

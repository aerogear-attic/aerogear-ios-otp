# aerogear-otp-ios [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-otp-ios.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-otp-ios)

##Objective-C One Time Password API

A iOS library for generating one time passwords according to [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

## Getting started

The project requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

_BEFORE_ you can run the tests, you need to run the following command:

    pod install

Now you are almost done! You just need to open the ```aerogear-otp.ios.xcworkspace``` in order to start hacking on the library code!

For more details, please refer to our [documentation](http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-security-otp/)

Enjoy!

## Getting started

The project requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

_BEFORE_ you can run the tests, you need to run the following command:

    pod install

Now you are almost done! You just need to open the ```aerogear-otp.ios.xcworkspace``` in order to start hacking on the library code!
